I'm swimming a little bit, like 500m in the morning.
Swimming offers a low-impact aerobic workout that allows you to get your
heart rate up without putting pressure on your joints.
It also targets the muscles in your legs, abdomen, shoulders and arms,
enabling one to build up more muscle strength and tone.

Got a shinny blue pants and then realized that I don't have a proper top
to match that fresh color.
So I need to buy some tops as well.
