Last month I visited an old friend who is now a photomaniac, 
I just couldn't stop him from shooting me. 
Then I have to face those scary photos - what a poor creature I have became.
I should try to gain some weight as well as buy some fitting clothes,
yeah, absolutely, maybe I will start next week.

Let's start with jeans,

**Waist**: place the tape horizontally on the smallest part of the waist.  
**Seat**: place the tape horizontally +/-20cm below the waist.  
**Thigh**: place the tape horizontally around the thigh +/-5cm under the crotch.  
**Inside Leg**: place the tape on the inside of the leg and measure from crotch to the ankle.

Whether they fit?  
They should fit perfectly around your waist without a belt.

I will try to get some new pants in next two days:)
